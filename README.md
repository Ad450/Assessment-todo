A simple Todo App
Our Simple ToDo App has a clear data flow that ensures data moves consistently through the application:

Data Sources: Data sources are responsible for interacting with external services or databases. They provide raw data to the application.

Repositories: Repositories act as an abstraction layer between data sources and use cases. They decide from which data source to fetch data and handle data transformation.

Use Cases: Use cases contain the business logic of the application. They orchestrate data operations by interacting with repositories. Use cases take raw data and format it for use in the UI.

State Management (BLoC): State management is handled by BLoC (Business Logic Component). BLoC manages the application's state and interacts with use cases to fetch and update data.

Presentation (UI): The user interface is built using Flutter, and it listens to the state managed by BLoC. When the state changes, the UI is updated to reflect the new data.
